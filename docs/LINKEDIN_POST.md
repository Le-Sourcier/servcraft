# 🚀 LinkedIn Announcement: ServCraft Launch

## Post Content

I’m thrilled to announce the launch of my latest project: **ServCraft** — a modular, production-ready Node.js framework designed to bridge the gap between rapid prototyping and enterprise-grade architecture.

Backend development often forces a trade-off between speed and structure. With ServCraft, you no longer have to choose.

### What makes ServCraft different?

- ✅ **Modular by Design**: Stop dealing with monolithic "spaghetti" code. Build self-contained, maintainable modules that scale.
- ✅ **Developer-First CLI**: From initializing projects to managing complex migrations, the CLI does the heavy lifting for you.
- ✅ **Seamless Tech Stack**: Built on the power of **TypeScript**, **Fastify** (for blazing speed), and **Prisma** (for type-safe data modeling).
- ✅ **Integrated Playground**: Test your ideas instantly in a sandboxed Docker environment before ever touching your local machine.

Whether you're building a lightweight microservice or a complex API ecosystem, ServCraft provides the foundation to build it right from day one. I built this project to empower developers to focus on what matters most: **building great features**, not fighting infrastructure.
